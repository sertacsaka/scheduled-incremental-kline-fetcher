## My first step towards learning Git and Spring Boot

This is a simple spring boot application that fetch data from Binance API and insert into MongoDB database.

I used MongoDB and Mongo Express with Docker to simplicity and clearness.

So, one can create the same environment by single docker-compose command.

Of course if you give to database a different name, you should also update "spring.data.mongodb.database" property in the "application.properties" file.
